##Binary

These are functions for encoding and decoding unsigned integers to slices of bytes for the purpose of reading/writing the integers to file efficiently.

These functions were written by The Go Programmers as private functions in Go's binary package. I stripped them out so I can use them directly, without their wrappers.
